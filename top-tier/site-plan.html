    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      An average customer spends less than 15 seconds on your website. Most of the
      time, your products or services are barely glanced at -- or worse, ignored altogether. Can you
      imagine how much more money you can earn if you have high-converting landing pages? That's
      what I do! I make landing pages that are customized to your business that will capture the
      attention of the client in 15 seconds and will surely lead to availing your product or service. I do
      this for a wide variety of businesses.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      My target audience is small to medium businesses located around the world. These individuals want their products
      or services not only to be seen but also to be availed. They will want their businesses to be seen by their target
      audience by having a robust online presence. Therefore, they will invest in a web developer specializing in
      semantic websites to build a customized and affordable landing page for their business instead of pricey websites
      that only detract the users from availing of their products or services.
